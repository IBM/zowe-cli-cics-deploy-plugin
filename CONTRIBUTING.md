# Contribution Guidelines
The contribution guidelines in this document pertain to contributing to this zowe-cli-cics-deploy-plugin repository.

We welcome bug reports and discussions about new function in the issue tracker, and we also welcome proposed new features or bug fixes via pull requests.

You should read these guidelines to help you contribute.

## Reporting a bug

Please raise bugs via the issue tracker. First, check whether an issue for your problem already exists.

When raising bugs, try to give a good indication of the exact circumstances that provoked the bug. What were you doing? What did you expect to happen? What actually happened? What logs or other material can you provide to show the problem?

## Requesting new features

Please request new features via the issue tracker. When requesting features, try to show why you want the feature you're requesting.

## Contributing code

### Before you start...

If you're thinking of fixing a bug or adding new features, be sure to open an issue first. This gives us a place to have a discussion about the work.

### Setting up your development environment

First of all, install Zowe CLI. Our plug-in is designed to work with the `lts-incremental` version.
```console
npm config set @brightside:registry https://api.bintray.com/npm/ca/brightside
npm install @brightside/core@lts-lncremental
```

In order to make code changes to the cics-deploy plugin, you'll need to fork the repository, and build the plugin from source.

```console
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_id>/zowe-cli-cics-deploy-plugin
cd zowe-cli-cics-deploy-plugin
npm install
npm run build
zowe plugins install .
```

### Developing the cics-deploy plug-in

As a plug-in for Zowe CLI, we aim to follow their guidelines. Our plugin is based on the Imperative CLI framework.

| Conventions and best practices for creating packages and plug-ins for Zowe CLI | [Package and Plug-in Guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/blob/master/docs/PackagesAndPluginGuidelines.md)|
| Guidelines for running tests on the plug-ins that you build for Zowe CLI | [Plug-in Testing Guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/blob/master/docs/PluginTESTINGGuidelines.md) |
| Documentation that describes the features of the Imperative CLI Framework | [About Imperative CLI Framework](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/wiki) |

As per the testing guidelines above, all code should have unit tests.  System tests should be written for cases where it's not necessary to interact with a remote CICS system. 

Please make sure all tests pass before opening a PR. 

### Licensing

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other

If you can certify the above, then sign off each Git commit at the bottom of the commit message with the following:

```
Signed-off-by: My Name <my.name@example.com>

You must use your real name and email address.

To save you having to type the above for every commit, Git can add the `Signed-off-by` line. When committing, add the `-s` option to your `git commit` command.

If you haven't signed each commit, then the pull request will fail to pass all checks.

## Branches and releases

We have three main branches in our repo:
- *dev*: our main dev branch, which will work with Zowe CLI @lts-incremental. New pull requests should normally be made into this branch.
- *master*: our release branch, which will work with Zowe CLI @lts-incremental. Project maintainers will merge code into here from `dev` when we're ready to release.
- *zowe-dev*: a branch which works with Zowe CLI@daily so we can prepare for forthcoming major releases of Zowe CLI.

### Release process

1. Ensure all code to be released is merged into `dev`.
2. Make a PR into `dev` to update the version number in `package.json` according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), 
   - Note: if the only changes being made are to the documentation, do not update the version number.  In this case the GitHub Pages site will be published when `master` is built, but no new version of the plug-in will be published.
3. Create a release branch locally based on `master`.
4. Merge commits to be released into the release branch. Avoid cherry-picking changes so that `master` always remains a subset of `dev`.
5. Make a PR to merge your release branch into `master`. The reviewer should make sure all commits are suitable to release and version number has been updated appropriately. 
6. After the PR is merged, Jenkins will run a build of `master` and publish the new version to registry.npmjs.org.
7. Delete the release branch.

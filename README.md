# zowe-cli-cics-deploy-plugin
This project aims to create a plugin for [Zowe CLI](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli) to deploy applications developed on a workstation to IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS),  Initially it will support deploying Node.js applications.  It aims to provide an experience similar to deploying to a cloud platform when deploying to CICS.  It will also provide low-level commands for performing individual steps of the deployment process that could be used as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Status
It is currently a work in progress at a fairly early stage. If you would like to try it out, you need to build the plugin from source as described in [setup](docs/tutorials/Setup.md).

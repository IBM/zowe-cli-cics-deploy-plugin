# zowe-cli-cics-deploy-plugin
This project provides a plugin for [Zowe CLI](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli) to deploy applications developed on a workstation to IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS (CICS). It aims to provide an experience similar to deploying to a cloud platform when deploying to CICS. It will also provide low-level commands for performing individual steps of the deployment process that could be used as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

## Status
The project was started in February 2019 and is at an early stage of development. It will initially focus on generating and deploying CICS bundles containing Node.js applications.

If you would like to try it out, you need to build the plugin from source as described in [setup](docs/tutorials/Setup.md).

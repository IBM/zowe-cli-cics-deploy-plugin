### Using the command-line

The command-line is a conventional way to run and/or compose programs, especially if you come from a Linux or macOS background. Despite its usefulness, it can become tedious when large numbers of command-line arguments have to be entered and re-entered every time a program is executed. Zowe CLI profiles eliminate a lot of this tedium by collecting sequences of rarely-changing command-line arguments into just one argument - the name of a Zowe CLI profile - which is used as proxy whenever the original longer sequence needs to be subsequently invoked.

{% include note.html content="Be aware that the broader Zowe and z/OS technology stack includes some other entities commonly referred to as <i>profiles</i> that are entirely different to the profiles discussed here, which are, specifically, Zowe CLI profiles. For example, there is a ```.profile``` file in most z/OS® Unix System Services (USS) user home directories - the remote z/OS shell profile - that contains session-initializing environmental configuration. A lack of precision, especially in conversation, can be confusing." %}

Instead of having to type, say, six command-line arguments that describe a collection of z/OS connection details, you only need to type one, the name and type of the profile that stores the full set.

### Examples of Zowe CLI profiles in action

As an example, a Zowe CLI z/OSMF profile aggregates the configuration details required to establish CLI z/OSMF sessions with the mainframe - such sessions are necessary to submit the batch jobs that deploy and undeploy [CICS bundles](cdp-CICS-bundles). You can create a Zowe CLI z/OSMF profile with a command like:

```text
zowe profiles create zosmf-profile myprofile --host zos124 --port 1443 --user ibmuser --password myp4ss --reject-unauthorized false
```

This creates a Zowe CLI z/OSMF profile called _myprofile_ that connects to port _1443_ (or, in your situation, such port as your own z/OSMF server is known to run on) on host _zos124_ using the credentials _ibmuser_ and _myp4ss_ and allowing self-signed certificates. That's six command-line arguments stored as a collection under the single profile called _myprofile_.

Now you can issue further Zowe commands that reference the profile you created earlier. For example, to check the health of your connectivity to z/OSMF you might enter:

```text
zowe zosmf check status --zosmf-profile myprofile
```

Zowe CLI profiles really come into their own when you decide to deploy your Node.js application(s) using `push bundle`. Using three profiles, you might issue:

```text
zowe push bundle --name EXAMPLE --target-directory /u/example/bundles --zosmf-profile testplex --cics-deploy-profile devcics --ssh-profile ssh
```

This is a much more economical and concise command-line than if were it necessary to enumerate all of the individual arguments from all of the profiles.

As suggested above, to deploy a Node.js application from your workstation to one or more CICS® regions, you will need to set up a minimum of three Zowe CLI profiles (optionally more if you wish to, say, deploy to multiple hosts) - you can read how to do it in detail [here](cdp-Creating-Zowe-CLI-profiles).

{% include tip.html content="For each profile type, the first profile you create becomes the default for that type. In many cases, you don't even have to type in the name of a specific profile if you know that the default profile will serve your needs." %}

Ultimately, you are not _required_ to use Zowe CLI profiles - you can specify all of the required command-line arguments explicitly - but they reduce the burden of typing when you are issuing commands that require many arguments.

### Order of precedence

The Zowe CLI lets you define arguments and options for commands in multiple ways, with the following order of precedence:

1. Command-line
2. Environment variables
3. Profiles

Therefore by setting options in a profile they will become your default and you do not need to repeat them on the command-line unless you wish to override them. Further details are in [Understanding command option order of precedence](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-configuringcli.html#understanding-command-option-order-of-precedence).

### Where are Zowe CLI profiles stored?

When you create a Zowe CLI profile, a representation is written to a file on your local workstation in plain text. This file may contain sensitive information such as user IDs and passwords and therefore needs to be secured. Further details are in [Creating Zowe CLI profiles](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/cli-configuringcli.html#creating-zowe-cli-profiles).

When you become familiar with their simple syntax, you can hand-edit these files, instead of regenerating the corresponding profiles.

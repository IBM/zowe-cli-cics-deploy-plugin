The Zowe CLI lets you define arguments and options for commands in multiple ways, with the following order of precedence:

1. Command-line
2. Environment variables
3. Profiles

Therefore by creating and setting options in the following profiles, they will become your defaults and you do not need to repeat them when using Zowe CLI commands unless you wish to override them. Further details are in [Understanding command option order of precedence](https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/latest/user-guide/cli-configuringcli.html#understanding-command-option-order-of-precedence).

The CICS deploy plug-in makes use of the following profiles:

| Profile | Used by command | Connects to z/OS server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [z/OSMF profile](#zosmf-profile) | **zowe cics-deploy ...** <br /> zowe console ... <br />  zowe zos-files ... <br />  zowe zos-jobs ... <br />  zowe zos-tso ... <br />  zowe zos-workflows ... <br />  zowe zosmf ... <br />  zowe provisioing ... | z/OSMF |
| [SSH profile](#ssh-profile) | **zowe cics-deploy push ...** <br />  zowe zos-uss ... | SSH |
| [CICS deploy profile](#cics-deploy-profile) | **zowe cics-deploy ...** |  |
| [CICS profile](#cics-profile) | **zowe cics-deploy push ...** <br />  zowe cics ... | CICSPlex SM WUI |

### z/OSMF profile

The z/OSMF profile defines the options needed to connect to the z/OSMF server on z/OS. You need to know the following from your z/OS system administrator:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| host | Host name of the z/OSMF server. |
| port | Port number of the z/OSMF server. |
| user | User ID to identify yourself to the z/OSMF server. |
| password | Password to identify yourself to the z/OSMF server. |

{% include note.html content="The user ID needs to have sufficient permissions to remove and create directories and files in the directory specified by `--targetdir` in the cics-deploy profile. The user ID also needs permission to submit JCL and to run the DFHDPLOY utility as described in the **Security** heading in topic [Automate the deployment and undeployment of CICS bundles and applications with the DFHDPLOY utility](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGMCP_5.5.0/applications/deploying/dfhdploy_overview.html)." %}

For example, to create a z/OSMF profile:

```text
zowe profiles create zosmf-profile myzos --host myzos.example.com --port 3000 --user myuserid --password mypassword --reject-unauthorized false --overwrite
```

For help on using the options:

```text
zowe profiles create zosmf-profile --help
```

To test the connection to the z/OSMF server using the profile:

```text
zowe zosmf check status
```

### SSH profile

The SSH profile defines the options needed to connect to the SSH server on z/OS. You need to know the following from your z/OS system administrator:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| host | Host name of the SSH server. |
| port | Port number of the SSH server. This will default to 22. |
| user | User ID to identify yourself to the SSH server. |
| password | Password to identify yourself to the SSH server. |

{% include note.html content="It is recommended that you use the same user ID and host name to connect with SSH as is used in the z/OSMF profile, failure to do so results in undefined behaviour. When an SSH connection is made, the user's remote [z/OS shell .profile](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.bpxa400/cupro.htm) is used to set-up the shell environment and variables. This remote .profile should include any necessary environment variables and npm configuration required to run `npm install`. This is described in [Installing and configuring](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTRRS_6.0.0/com.ibm.nodejs.zos.v6.doc/install.htm)." %}

For example, to create an SSH profile:

```text
zowe profiles create ssh-profile myzos --host myzos.example.com --user myuserid --password mypassword --overwrite
```

For help on using the options:

```text
zowe profiles create ssh-profile --help
```

To test the connection to the SSH server using the profile:

```text
zowe zos-uss issue ssh 'uname -a'
```

### CICS deploy profile

The cics-deploy profile identifies the CICS environment for deployment. An example of how to create an environment using using z/OS Provisioning Toolkit as described in [Provisioning a CICS region using z/OS PT](cdp-Provisioning-a-CICS-region-using-zospt). You need to know the following from your CICS system administrator:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cicsplex | CPSM CICSplex name. |
| cics-hlq | High Level Qualifier \(HLQ\) for the CICS data sets. |
| cpsm-hlq | High Level Qualifier \(HLQ\) for the CPSM data sets. |
| scope | CPSM scope to identify the CICS region or group of regions to deploy your application. |
| csd-group or res-group | CICS CSD group name or CPSM BAS resource group name into which the bundle is defined. If not specified, BUNDLE resources are defined in CPSM BAS for installation and then removed. |
| job-card | JCL jobcard to use when submitting JCL that will run the CICS utility DFHDPLOY. If not specified, a default job card will be used. |
| target-directory | Target directory on z/OS to which CICS bundles should be uploaded. |

For example to create a cics-deploy profile:

```text
zowe profiles create cics-deploy-profile cics --cicsplex PLEX1 --cics-hlq CICSTS55.CICS720 --cpsm-hlq CICSTS55.CPSM550 --scope CICPY000 --csd-group BUNDGRP1 --target-directory /var/cicsts/bundles --overwrite
```

For help on using the options:

```text
zowe profiles create cics-deploy-profile --help
```

To test the cics-deploy profile, follow the steps in [Deploying a Node.js application](cdp-Deploying-a-nodejs-application).

### CICS profile

The CICS profile identifies the connection to the CICS Web User Interface (WUI) server to query application resources. You need to know the following from your CICS system administrator:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cics-plex | CPSM CICSplex name. This will typically be set to the same as cicsplex in the cics-deploy profile. |
| region-name | The name of the CICS region name to interact with. |
| protocol | HTTP or HTTPS to use to connect to the CICS WUI server. |
| host | Host name of the CICS WUI server. |
| port | Port number of the CICS WUI server. |
| user | User ID to identify yourself to the CICS WUI server . |
| password | Password to identify yourself to the CICS WUI server. |

For example, to create an SSH profile:

```text
zowe profiles create cics-profile cics --cics-plex PLEX1 --region-name CICPY000 --protocol https --host myzos.example.com --port 1490 --user myuserid --password mypassword --overwrite
```

For help on using the options:

```text
zowe profiles create cics-profile --help
```

To test the connection to the CICS WUI server using the profile:

```text
zowe cics get resource CICSRegion | grep -E "applid|cicsstatus|jobname|mvssysname|strttime|cputime"
```

<pre class="messageText">
applid:       CICPY00V
cicsstatus:   ACTIVE
cputime:      0000:02:29.2824
jobname:      CICPY00V
mvssysname:   MV2C
strttime:     2019-06-13T16:08:15.938572+00:00</pre>

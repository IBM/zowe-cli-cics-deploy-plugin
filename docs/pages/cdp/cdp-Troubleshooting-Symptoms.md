{% include important.html content="To definitively diagnose a problem based on the suggested symptoms, you might need to refer to one or more [system logs and traces](cdp-Troubleshooting-General) particularly the STDERR Node.js log and the file assigned the MSGUSR DD name in the relevant CICS DFHDPLOY job. Depending on your familiarity with z/OS and CICS, and your system privileges, you may also need to consult a CICS systems administrator to get to the bottom of certain problems." %}

## Deployment errors

### Application incorrectly deploys in a DISABLED state
*Possible cause*: The port requested by the application is already in use.

*Suggested action*: Choose a new port number after double-checking that it is not in use. Redeploy the application using the new value for the port.

{% include note.html content="An application in a `DISABLED` state does not necessarily indicate an error condition. The `cics-deploy deploy`, `cics-deploy push` and `cics-deploy undeploy` commands allow you to specify a `--target-state` option which you may deliberately choose to set to `DISABLED`." %}

### Command error: DFHDPLOY stopped processing due to an error
*Possible causes*:
  * The `--scope` and/or `--cicsplex` settings for the current deploy profile are wrong, and don't correctly identify a current CICS system, CICS System Group and/or a correct CICSPlex respectively.

  * The CMAS for the current CICSPlex is inactive.

  * CPSM is not functioning correctly.

*Representative output*:

*Suggested actions*:
  * Confirm that the `--scope` and `--cicsplex` settings are correct.

  * Ask your CICS Systems Programmer to check that the CMAS for the current CICSPlex is alive and that CPSM is working properly.

### Command error: ... validation of - -cicshlq dataset failed: z/OSMF REST API Error
*Possible cause*: The profile setting for `--cicshlq` is incorrect.

*Representative output*:
<pre class="messageText">
A failure occurred during CICS bundle deployment.
Reason = Validation of --cicshlq dataset failed: z/OSMF REST API Error:

Check that your `--cicshlq` profile setting matches the value configured for CICS high-level qualifiers in your CICS region. 

### BUNDLE ... cannot be deployed
*Possible cause*: The `cics.xml` file is malformed.

*Suggested action*: 
Check that your `cics.xml` file is well-formed.

## General errors
### Syntax error: Invalid value length for option
*Possible cause*: The length of the option you provided in a command was either too long or two short.

*Representative output*:
<pre class="messageText">
Syntax Error:
Invalid value length for option:
--csdgroup

You specified a string of length 9:
NODETESTS

The length must be between 1 and 8 (inclusive)
</pre>

*Suggested action*: 
Review the error output text and reissue the original command having corrected the name of the option so that its length falls within acceptable limits.
